# `lset`: The **L**inux **S**treamer's **E**ssential **T**oolkit

Ever wanted to stream on Linux and *really* don't want to mess with any yucky online services to make your stream worthwhile? Well now you can, using your own self hosted tools!

Here you can find two separate programs: a Node.JS Twitch bot and a Python script for a follower/sub goal. In order to set it up, you can run the `install.sh` script to set up both the programs, or you can view the documents for both the [Twitch bot]() and the [Python script]() to set them up separately.
